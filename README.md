# automizedDoE

*automizedDoE* helps you generating, processing and analyze experimental plans based on Design of Experiments. 

It generates experimental plans, maps the plan to your given factor values, creates a well ordered folder structure, processes given input scripts and analyzes the experiments output.
That might help you when you want to perform parameter analyses or create statistical significant data for machine learning based on an experiment or a simulation.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have a Unix machine (Mac/Linux). Currently only tested with Ubuntu20.04
* You have Python3 and pip3 installed on your machine.
*  You have a command line interface or script based experiment / simulation


## Installing automizedDoE
You can install it easily via pip:
```
pip3 install automizedDoE
```
Or clone the git repo directly and run the program in a virtual environment:
```
git clone ...
cd automizedDoE
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting started
It is recommended to take a look at the given examples and its *readme*'s and the documentation for more detailed explanations. 
Some theoretical knowledge of Design of Experiments would also be advantageous.

Nevertheless the basic setup of automizedDoE remains the same. 


### Setting up your experiment environment
A working folder must be created with the following content (in some exceptional cases input can be different):
* `config.conf`: file contains your settings for the DoE Analysis
* `factors.csv`: file contains the factors you want to analyze with min and max values
* `templates`: folder contains all necessary input for your experiment of simulation

For the beginning just copy an existing exmample folder (e.g. helloDoE) to your preferred location and modify the files based on your needs. 

### Starting automizedDoE
Just run 
```
automizedDoE /path/to/your/working/folder
```

### Results
The results will be 2 files + 2 folders:
* `factorPlan.csv`: file contains the raw experimental plan with values between min and max of the factor value
* `rawPlan.csv`: file contains the raw experimental plan with values between 0 and 1
* `simulationFolder`: folder contains raw experiment / simulation results for each run of your experimental plan
* `results`: folder contains the combined results of all experiment / simulation runs as csv-file.
